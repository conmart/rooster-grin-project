# front-end-dev-test from Rooster Grin

### Technologies Used

Besides the regular html, css, and js I also utilized Materialize as a front end framework as I really enjoy their design aesthetic and have used it in the past.

### Struggles and Setbacks

Getting a gradient over the hero images of the slider while at the same time making sure the images filled the whole slide and were responsive was pretty tricky for me as I'd never had so many factors to consider for an image before. Also, while I love Materialize it was a bit of pain to customize the input fields to get them to look like the mock ups.

### Final Reflections

I enjoyed this project as a whole more than I thought I would. It was a lot of fun to watch the site come together and format it so that it looks good no matter what device is accessing it, which has been a weakness of mine.
